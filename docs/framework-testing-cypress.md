# Cypress v7.7.0

## Limitations

- Save video only for failure. [Link to reference (July 2021)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2522#issuecomment-749316813)

- Though running cypress in docker does not require cypress.
  - But using typescript would require installing cypress
  - plugins is limited to what the docker image has
