TODO:
- move away from commonjs module and use verbatimModuleSyntax for typescript
- use create react app for boilerplate-cra
- find rename environment to application and application to context?
- have a single way to retrieve data from both application and context
- merge theme with application? at least from components perspective, so that components are retrieve from a single function
- theme => serializable
- context => none serializable stuff
- when using a boundary/suspense, it should always have a fallback unless we explicitly ask it not to
- also lint .storybook folder
- fix quick lint, it is not returning all the errors
